Lorry Drivers style glove made with a full micro-foam nitrile coating and a soft fleece liner. This unique glove has the look and style of a conventional leather driver’s glove but is considerably lighter in weight, more dexterous and more competitively priced. The 360° micro-foam coating is consistently thinner and more flexible than traditional foam nitrile yet offers improved mechanical performance. As well as an excellent dry grip, the micro-foam coating offers optimum wet grip by channeling liquids away from the glove surface and the soft fleece lining keeps the hands warm and comfortable at all times. Adjustable Velcro wrist strap ensures a secure fit and helps to keep hands free from dust and debris. Delivers excellent abrasion protection, durability, and a long life expectancy.
